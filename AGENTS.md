LMLM Control Plane Dashboard — Codex Implementation Task

Create and integrate a new production-quality dashboard page for the LMLM Control Plane based on the provided reference image and the LMLM + NVIDIA NIM architecture described below.

The dashboard must be implemented inside the existing repository. Do not create a disconnected demo application unless the repository is empty.

1. Core technology requirements

Use:

* React
* Vite
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS

Use existing project dependencies and design-system components where available. Do not introduce unnecessary dependencies.

If the repository already uses React/Vite/Tailwind, preserve the existing architecture and conventions.

The implementation must be responsive and work correctly on desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts.

2. Dashboard purpose

The dashboard represents the LMLM intelligent inference control plane.

The conceptual architecture is:

Script.god
    ↓
GOD Protocol
    ↓
LMLM Go Coordinator
    ↓
Task Router
    ↓
Model Registry
    ↓
Model Adapters
    ↓
Inference Backends

Supported inference backends include:

NVIDIA NIM
OpenAI
Local CUDA / Local LLM
Future model providers

NVIDIA NIM must be represented as a first-class model adapter/backend, not as the LMLM intelligence layer itself.

The UI should communicate this distinction clearly.

3. Primary route

Create a dedicated route:

/lmlm

If the project already has an established routing structure, integrate /lmlm using that structure rather than replacing the router.

The route should render the complete LMLM Control Plane dashboard.

4. Visual direction

Use the supplied reference image as the visual source of truth.

Match the reference as closely as possible with respect to:

* overall composition
* spacing
* padding
* margins
* typography
* font weights
* font sizes
* border radius
* panel dimensions
* navigation hierarchy
* card density
* alignment
* visual hierarchy
* responsive behavior
* dark/light surface relationships
* icons
* status indicators
* charts/visualizations
* hover states
* active states

Do not merely reproduce the textual content.

Recreate the visual system and information architecture.

If the reference image and these architectural requirements conflict, preserve the visual language of the reference while adapting the content to the LMLM architecture.

5. Main dashboard structure

Implement a professional AI infrastructure control-plane interface.

The desktop layout should contain:

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                         TOP HEADER                           │
├───────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│               │  Model Routing                               │
│               │                                              │
│               │  Runtime Topology                            │
│               │                                              │
│               │  Script.god Activity                         │
│               │                                              │
└───────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

6. Sidebar

Create navigation for:

Overview
Models
Routing
Script.god
Memory
Verification
Infrastructure

The active route must have a visually distinct state.

Show a system-health indicator near the bottom:

● System healthy
NIM cluster · GPU node

Use icons consistently.

The sidebar should collapse appropriately on smaller screens.

7. Header

Create a top navigation/header containing:

LMLM / Overview
Intelligence Orchestration

Include:

* search control
* keyboard shortcut indicator
* settings button
* user/profile indicator
* responsive mobile navigation trigger

The header should remain visually consistent with the reference.

8. Status section

Show the current runtime status:

● Operational

Supporting description:

A model-agnostic control plane for routing tasks across
NVIDIA NIM, cloud providers and local runtimes.

Provide a primary action:

Run task

The button should have an interactive state.

For example, clicking it may transition to:

Task running

Do not pretend an actual inference task occurred unless a backend API exists.

9. Metrics

Create four metric cards:

Active Models
2 / 3
1 model in standby
Requests / min
1,284
+18.6% from last hour
Avg Latency
184 ms
p95 · 312 ms
Verification
99.4%
last 10,000 tasks

These should be reusable components.

Do not hardcode styling repeatedly.

Create a reusable metric-card component.

10. Model Routing panel

Create a model-routing section showing capability matching and routing scores.

Initial models:

NVIDIA

Llama 3.1 70B
NVIDIA NIM
Reasoning
Online
Score: 92
Latency: 184 ms
Context: 128K
Priority: 80

Cloud

GPT model
OpenAI
General
Online
Score: 87
Latency: 221 ms
Context: 256K
Priority: 74

Local

Local CUDA
LMLM Runtime
Fast / Private
Standby
Score: 74
Latency: 96 ms
Context: 32K
Priority: 68

Represent the score visually using progress bars.

The routing panel should clearly communicate that LMLM dynamically selects a model according to capabilities, policy, latency, priority and task requirements.

11. Runtime topology

Create a visual topology diagram representing:

Script.god
Policy · routing · coordination
        │
        ▼
GOD Protocol
CONNECT · TASK · ROUTE · VERIFY
        │
        ▼
 ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐
 │ NVIDIA NIM │   OpenAI   │   Local    │
 │ Llama 70B  │ GPT family │ CUDA       │
 └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘
        │
        ▼
Kubernetes inference fabric

The topology should look like a real infrastructure visualization rather than plain text.

Use connecting lines and status indicators.

NVIDIA NIM should be visually emphasized as an active backend.

12. Script.god activity

Create an activity table showing recent orchestration events.

Example events:

ROUTE
reasoning task → nvidia-llama-3.1-70b
184 ms
2s ago
success
VERIFY
response integrity · 4 checks passed
42 ms
18s ago
success
REGISTER
model nvidia-llama-3.1-70b discovered
61 ms
2m ago
success
SYNC
context state → memory layer
28 ms
4m ago
success

Use appropriate semantic styling for:

CONNECT
REGISTER
TASK
ACK
CONTEXT
PROGRESS
RESULT
ERROR
BLOCKED
CANCEL
VERIFY
SYNC
ROUTE

The UI should be ready to receive real event data later.

13. Script.god integration model

Do not implement Script.god as a fake backend.

Create frontend types/interfaces that can later consume real LMLM API responses.

For example:

interface ModelDefinition {
  id: string;
  provider: string;
  runtime: string;
  capabilities: string[];
  status: "online" | "standby" | "offline";
  latencyMs?: number;
  priority?: number;
}
interface RoutingDecision {
  task: string;
  selectedModel: string;
  score: number;
  reason?: string;
}
interface GodEvent {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  message: string;
  latencyMs?: number;
  timestamp: string;
  status: "success" | "error" | "pending";
}

Keep the data layer separate from the visual components.

14. Model registry representation

Represent the LMLM model registry conceptually as:

models:
  - id: nvidia-llama-3.1-70b
    provider: nvidia
    runtime: nim
    model: meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct
    capabilities:
      - text
      - reasoning
      - instruction_following
    endpoint:
      protocol: openai-compatible
      path: /v1/chat/completions
      port: 8000
    deployment:
      platform: kubernetes
      accelerator: nvidia-gpu
    routing:
      priority: 80
      cost_class: high
      latency_class: medium

Do not expose NVIDIA/NGC credentials anywhere in the frontend.

Never place API keys in:

React source
TypeScript files
Tailwind configuration
Vite client environment variables
README examples

15. Component architecture

Break the page into reusable components.

Suggested structure:

src/
├── pages/
│   └── LMLMDashboard/
│       ├── LMLMDashboard.tsx
│       ├── Sidebar.tsx
│       ├── Header.tsx
│       ├── MetricCard.tsx
│       ├── ModelRouting.tsx
│       ├── ModelCard.tsx
│       ├── RuntimeTopology.tsx
│       ├── ScriptGodActivity.tsx
│       └── StatusIndicator.tsx
│
├── types/
│   └── lmlm.ts
│
└── ...

Adapt this structure to the repository’s existing conventions.

Do not create unnecessary abstraction.

16. State and interactions

Implement realistic frontend interactions:

* sidebar navigation state
* active model selection
* Run Task button state
* search UI
* model registration action UI
* routing selection
* responsive navigation
* hover/focus states
* topology node highlighting

Use local mock data initially if no backend exists.

Make the mock-data boundary obvious so it can later be replaced with:

GET /api/models
GET /api/routing
GET /api/events
GET /api/health
POST /api/tasks

Do not fabricate successful backend responses.

17. Backend readiness

The frontend should be designed around this eventual architecture:

Browser
   │
   ▼
LMLM Dashboard
   │
   ▼
LMLM API
   │
   ▼
Go Coordinator
   │
   ├── Model Registry
   ├── Task Router
   ├── Context Manager
   ├── Verification
   └── Script.god Runtime
          │
          ▼
     Model Adapters
          │
     ┌────┼───────────┐
     ▼    ▼           ▼
   NIM  OpenAI     Local CUDA
     │
     ▼
 Kubernetes
     │
     ▼
 NVIDIA GPU

The dashboard must not directly call NVIDIA NIM from browser code.

18. Accessibility

Use:

* semantic HTML
* accessible buttons
* keyboard navigation
* visible focus states
* appropriate ARIA labels where necessary
* sufficient text contrast
* meaningful status labels

Do not rely solely on color to communicate status.

19. Responsive behavior

Desktop:

persistent sidebar
multi-column dashboard
full topology visualization

Tablet:

reduced sidebar
responsive cards
two-column content where appropriate

Mobile:

collapsible navigation
single-column cards
horizontal scrolling only where genuinely necessary
stacked topology

Avoid horizontal page overflow.

20. Performance

Keep the implementation lightweight.

Avoid unnecessary animation libraries.

Prefer:

* CSS transitions
* Tailwind utilities
* React state
* lightweight icon library if already installed

Do not introduce a charting library unless the existing project already uses one or it is genuinely necessary.

21. README

Create or update:

README.md

Document:

1. What the dashboard is.
2. Architecture.
3. Technologies.
4. Installation.
5. Local development.
6. Production build.
7. Route.
8. Mock-data behavior.
9. Future LMLM API integration.
10. Security considerations.

Include:

npm install
npm run dev

and:

npm run build
npm run preview

Document the dashboard route:

http://localhost:5173/lmlm

If the project’s Vite configuration uses another port, document the actual port.

22. Verification requirements

Before completing the task:

1. Install dependencies if required.
2. Run TypeScript validation.
3. Run the production build.
4. Start the development server.
5. Open /lmlm.
6. Verify the page renders without runtime errors.
7. Verify browser console errors are absent.
8. Verify responsive behavior.
9. Verify all navigation and primary interactions.
10. Fix any issues discovered during verification.

If browser automation tooling is available, use it to perform a visual verification of the rendered page.

Do not claim verification was performed if it was not.

23. Important security requirement

The NVIDIA credentials previously supplied in the task context are sensitive.

Do not copy, preserve, echo, log, commit, or embed those credentials anywhere.

The frontend must contain zero real credentials.

Use placeholders only where documentation requires an example.

24. Final deliverables

The completed implementation must contain:

✓ React
✓ Vite
✓ TypeScript
✓ Tailwind CSS
✓ New /lmlm route
✓ LMLM Control Plane dashboard
✓ Reusable components
✓ Model routing UI
✓ NVIDIA NIM representation
✓ Runtime topology
✓ Script.god activity
✓ Responsive design
✓ Accessible controls
✓ Mock-data separation
✓ README.md
✓ Successful TypeScript/build validation

At completion, report:

Implementation:
- files created/modified
- route added
- components added
- dependencies added
Validation:
- typecheck result
- build result
- browser verification result
Run:
npm install
npm run dev
Route:
/lmlm

Do not stop at generating static markup. Implement the page completely inside the repository and verify that it actually runs.
